      My first day of the trip! I can't believe I finally got
      everything packed and ready to go. Because I'm on a Segway,
      I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me: cell phone, iPod,
      digital camera, and a protein bar. Just the essentials. As
      Lao Tzu would have said, "A journey of a thousand miles begins
      with one Segway."
