* Document Key
- C
  - The control key. *e.g.* =C-x= is =Ctrl= + =x=.
- M
  - The =meta= key.  This key does not exist on most modern keyboards.  To simulate, this is usually mapped to pressing (and releasing) the Esc key once.  It is sometimes also mapped to the =Alt= key. *e.g.* =M-x= is =Alt= + =x=.

- C-<key>
  - Hold the control key, and press <key>.

- M-<key>
  - Hold the =Alt= key, and press <key>.
    Or press the =Esc= key once, and press <key>.
- S-x
  is =Shift= + =x=
- C-M-x
  is =Ctrl= + =Alt= + =x=

* Mark, region and kill ring (Point, mark, and region)
‚Ä¢ Mark and region
+ Mark is a special text position set by the command =C-Space=
+ Region is the text between the point (current cursor) and the mark
+ Flexibility: set mark once and adjust the region by moving the cursor

‚Ä¢ Kill ring
+ The greedy clipboard of Emacs
+ M-w, C-w, C-y: copy, cut, yank (paste)
+ M-y: paste the previously copied/cut texts
+ C-k, M-d, C-Backspace, C-Del, . . . store deleted texts into kill ring

** make cursor jump back to the previous position
- C-SPC C-SPC
  -  In Emacs you can save the position of the cursor by pressing ~C-space C-space~.
  - set mark (activates and then deactivates region) pushes the
    current position to the mark ring (without leaving it active).

- C-u C-SPC
  - When you are in another part of the document, jump back with
    ~C-u C-space~.
  - move to previous mark pops the mark ring, jumping to the
    previous position. You can use this repeatedly to navigate
    through the entire ring.

- Exchange point and mark
- C-x C-x
  - =exchange-point-and-mark= which is very useful for jumping between two locations. It also activates the mark-or-region, use =C-SPC= to clear the highlighting.

- C-x C-x
  - exchange-point-and-mark

  - Put the mark where point is now, and point where the
    mark is now.  This command works even when the mark is
    not active, and it reactivates the mark.

  - If Transient Mark mode is on, a prefix ARG deactivates
    the mark if it is active, and otherwise avoids
    reactivating it.  If Transient Mark mode is off, a
    prefix ARG enables Transient Mark mode temporarily.

- C-x C-@ and C-x C-SPC

  - (pop-global-mark) Pop off global mark ring and jump to
    the top location.  The global mark ring is updated
    automatically
* Getting Help
** Meta Help

*** Regular Expression
In order to mark the items that are matched by the search terms.
+ =%= and then =m=
Let's search for all the files whose ending is =.el= by entering /\.el/ in minibuffer.

Now you can see item has been marked is by the astrict(=*=) sign on the left side of window.

+ Toggle the mark by pressing: *t*
It'll reverse the matching terms. So instead of matching items, it do reverse of selection.

+ This is irritating on two levels.
1. The key bindings are on a difficult to use keymap.
2. There‚Äôs no easy entry point and there are too many commands to do simple
   tasks.

- These variables can be used to customize Hideshow mode:
+ If non-nil, =C-c= =@= =C-M-h= (=hs-hide-all=) hides comments too.

- ~hs-isearch-open~
 - Specifies what kind of hidden blocks to open in =isearch-mode=.
The value should be one of these four symbols.

- =code= (open only code blocks)
- =comment= (open only comments)
- ~t~ (open both code blocks and comments).
- ~nil~ (open neither code blocks nor comments)

- ~hs-special-modes-alist~
 - A list of elements, each specifying how to initialize Hideshow variables for
   one major mode. See the variable's documentation string for more information.

* Bookmarks

Note that some commands (especially ones which are liable to move you an unknown
or arbitrary distance from your original location) will automatically push to
the mark ring so that you can use ~C-u C-SPC~ to return afterwards. This includes
=isearch=, so after using =C-s= to go somewhere, you can easily jump back again.

| Shortcut | Command Invoked     | Description            |
|----------+---------------------+------------------------|
| C-x r m  | bookmark-set        | Create / set bookmark. |
| C-x r b  | bookmark-jump       | Open bookmark.         |
| C-x r l  | bookmark-bmenu-list | List bookmarks.        |

+ Delete Bookmark
  - go to Bookmark and Select by pressing ~d~ than to Delete press ~x~

* Registers

If you're taking advantage of register functionality in elisp, use some
non-conflicting symbol for the name, rather than a char, so that you can't
conflict with interactively-set registers (unless, of course, you want to do
that). \\
The register retains this information until you store something else in it.

- C-x r SPC r
  - =point-to-register=, followed by a character r. Record the position of point and the current buffer in register =r=.

- C-x r j r
  - =jump-to-register= Jump to the position and buffer saved in register =r=.

(The mark is not pushed if point was already at the recorded position, or in successive calls to the command.) The contents of the register are not changed, so you can jump to the saved position any number of times.

If you use C-x r j to go to a saved position, but the buffer it was saved from has been killed, C-x r j tries to create the buffer again by visiting the same file. Of course, this works only for buffers that were visiting files.

** Save Positions in Registers
- C-x r SPC
  - runs point-to-register

- C-x r j
  - runs jump-to-register
  Type any character to specify a register when prompted.

narrow-to-region (C-x n n) Then widen (C-x n w)

move the point to the end of any sexp and press
- C-x C-e
  - to execute just that sexp in elisp program.  Usually it's not necessary to reload the whole file if you're just changing a line or two.

- M-: (load user-init-file)
you type it in Eval: prompt (including the parentheses)
user-init-file is a variable holding the =~/.emacs= value (pointing to the configuration file path) by default
(load) is shorter, older, and non-interactive version of (load-file); it is not an emacs command (to be typed in M-x) but a mere elisp function

- M-/
  - EXPAND ABBREVIATION - the command abbrev-expand, is an autoloaded interactive compiled Lisp function

- C-M-o
  - Split line at point; text on the line after point becomes a new line indented to the same column that it now starts in (split-line).
- M-m
  - Move (forward or back) to the first nonblank character on the current line (back-to-indentation).
- C-M-\
  - Indent several lines to same column (indent-region).
- C-q TAB
  - Insert a literal \T into your code somewhere.
- C-x TAB
  - Shift block of lines rigidly right or left (indent-rigidly).
- M-i
  - Indent from point to the next prespecified tab stop column (tab-to-tab-stop).
- M-x =indent-relative=
  - Indent from point to under an indentation point in the previous line.

- C-5 C-x TAB
  - you can specify the number of spaces to indent by using a prefix argument

- C-x r t or =M-x= =string-rectangle=
  - This one inserts text at every line in the rectangle.

%% Start by setting the mark at the beginning of the first line, and move your cursor to the first character of the last line you want to prefix:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
*Hello
There
‚ñÆI am some code
#+END_EXAMPLE

%% Then use C-x r t, enter your prefix (I said) and press RET. This adds the text to each line in the rectangle:
#+begin_example
  I said Hello
  I said There
  I said I am some code
#+end_example

%% If you don't line up your cursor on the same column as your mark, it will overwrite that part of the rectangle:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
*Hello
There
I am‚ñÆ some code
#+END_EXAMPLE

%% with the same command results in:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
I said o
I said e
I said  some code
#+END_EXAMPLE

- C-x r t       - string-rectangle (used to insert any arbitrary text (spaces included) in a selected region.)

%% Let's say you have this block of text and you want to insert 5 spaces in front of all lines.
#+begin_example
abc
def
ghi
#+end_example

- C-x r t M-5 SPC RET   - That will give the below force indented text.
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
abc
def
ghi
#+END_EXAMPLE

- IMHO the standard way is:
   1) Go to the top of your buffer.
   2) Type C-M-% for query-replace-regexp.
   3) Input ^\s-+ as regular expression and RET. (See explanation below.)
   4) Leave the replacement string empty, i.e., press RET again.
   5) You are prompted by query-replace-regexp in the minibuffer.
   6) Press ! to perform all replacements at once.

Explanation of the regular expression:
1) The caret ^ stands for the beginning of line.
2) The \s- stands for any character designated as space by the current modes syntax table.
3) The + stands for one or more contiguous matches.

* Projectile
- Simply open any file in the git project using =C-x C-f= and then try running
  command ~C-c~ ~p~ ~f~.

+ Opening a file in a git project will make projectile recognize the project.

- I think your project is indeed considered a project by =projectile= only if
  you have a =.git= folder in it (did you forget to =git init=?). I'm not seeing
  one in your case. You can alternatively add a =.projectile= file
  instead. Everything in that folder containing the =.projectile= file and all
  subfolders will be considered part of the same project.

* ORG
This topic =Org= is pretty huge on it's own. So, I made a separate manual for
=org-mode= and moved everything about =org-mode= there. \\
